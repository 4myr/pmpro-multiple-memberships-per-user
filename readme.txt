Requires at least: 4.8
Tested up to: 4.8.1
Stable tag: .1.1

Updates the core Paid Memberships Pro plugin to allow users to have multiple memberships at the same time.

== Description ==

IMPORTANT: This plugin is considered to be in "beta" status. Use at your own risk. In particular, almost all of the
other PMPro add ons that adjust the checkout process, membership pricing, user subscriptions, or perform actions when
users change membership levels will NOT currently work as you might expect with this plugin active.

Specifically, most PMPro add ons assume that users will only have one membership level at a time and 
don't "know what to do" when users have multiple levels or cancel multiple levels at once. We will be updating
our add ons over time to support MMPU and will add notices here and on our website when we do.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-multiple-memberships-per-user` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Changelog ==
